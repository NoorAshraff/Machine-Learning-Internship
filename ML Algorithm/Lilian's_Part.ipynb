        "The decision tree operates by analyzing the data set to predict its classification. It commences from the tree’s root node, where the algorithm views the value of the root attribute compared to the attribute of the record in the actual data set. Based on the comparison, it proceeds to follow the branch and move to the next node.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm repeats this action for every subsequent node by comparing its attribute values with those of the sub-nodes and continuing the process further. It repeats until it reaches the leaf node of the tree. The complete mechanism can be better explained through the algorithm given below.\n",
